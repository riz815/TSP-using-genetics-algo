Travelling Salesman Problem solved by using Genetics Algorithm
Genetic algorithms are heuristic search algorithms inspired by the process that supports the evolution of life. The algorithm is designed to replicate the natural selection process to carry generation, i.e. survival of the fittest of beings. Standard genetic algorithms are divided into five phases which are: 
Creating initial population.
Calculating fitness.
Selecting the best genes.
Crossing over.
Mutating to introduce variations.
